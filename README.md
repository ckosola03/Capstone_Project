# Capstone_Project

The project that Gavin Lusk and I will be working on is a solar powered shower. This project would solve the problem of needing to rinse off or shower while camping or doing other outdoor activites without access to a shower. The shower would have a solar panel that would power a water pump. That water pump would then transport water from a tub or container of water to the shower head. The water would then come out providing a solar powered shower.
